[![build using reveal-md](https://github.com/HMegh/reveal-md-template/actions/workflows/static-reveal-md.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HMegh/reveal-md-template/actions/workflows/static-reveal-md.yml)

This is a template for creating presentations using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md). Hereâ€™s a [link](https://hmegh.github.io/reveal-md-template/#/) to view the template.

## Usage: 

You can either use this template locally or on GitHub (using GitHub pages): 

* **Locally:** First install [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), then run the following 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HMegh/reveal-md-template
    cd reveal-md-template
    reveal-md main.md --watch 
    ```
* **Using GitHub:** Clone this repo, then go to Settings>Actions>General and check "Read and write permissions" in "workflow permissions". Then go to "pages" and deploy the "gh-pages" branch (if you want). 


## Note:

This is still work in progress. I will be adding some extra css customization in the future.  Any contributions are welcome.
